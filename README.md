# The Hawk Member Management System 
_The last member mapping and data management system for non-profits._

Hawk was created as a way for watershed protection agencies to quickly and easily retrieve accurate data about their donors. It serves primarily as a cross-referencing tool, determining which residential addresses can be considered "waterfront" (and therefore potential donors), and cross-references these addresses with other sources to obtain cruicial information such as billing addresses. This allows non-profits to send promotional mail to potential donors **even in the off-season**, by sending mail to billing addresses instead of local ones.

Take a look at the [Hawk Summary](https://github.com/palmtrey/Hawk/blob/main/Hawk%20Summary.pdf) for a deep dive into how the system works.
